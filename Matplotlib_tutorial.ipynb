    "\n",
    "The earth's crust is made up of tectonic plates that are slowly moving but get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel.  Everyday there are lots of little earthquakes that occur around the world.  Much less frequently are large earthquakes that we can feel and cause damage.\n",

    "Sometimes these plates move apart, sometimes they slide past eachother, and sometimes one  slides under the other.  In the Pacific Northwest, we have the Juan de Fuca plate diving beneath the North America plate.
